Emerging AI technologies not only pose threats but also create opportunities of
producing a wide variety of data types from human interactions with these
platforms. The broad availability of data has led to increasing interest in
methods for exploring useful knowledge relevant to education. In other words,
data-driven decision-making through the collection and analysis of educational
data is increasingly used to inform policy and practice, and this trend is only
likely to grow in the future.

The literature on education data analytics has many materials on the assessment
and prediction of students’ academic performance, as measured by standardized
tests. However, research on education data analytics should go beyond
explaining student success with the typical three Rs (reading, writing and
arithmetic) of literacy in the current economy. Furthermore, the availability of
data alone does not ensure successful data-driven decision-making.
Consequently, there is a need for further research on the use of an appropriate
data-analytic thinking framework for education.
